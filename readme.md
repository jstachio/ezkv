# Kiwi

A non-opinionated Java *bootstrapping configuration* library
that allows recursive chain loading of configuration from key values.



**Key values are everywhere** 
(also known as an associative arrays, list of tuples, or name value pairs)!

Environment variables, System properties, cloud meta data, vault,
HTTP FORM post, URI queries, command line arguments
even most forms of JSON, HOCON, TOML YAML and XML
can all be represented as simple *"key value"* pairs.

Thus it is the perfect common denominator for providing applications with initial configuration.
We call this *"bootstrapping configuration"* and it is usually gathered even before logging.

To do this Kiwi loads streams of key values (KeyValue) from resources. 
What is unique about it is that certain key values will load more key values to the current
stream which is what we call chaining.

    URI -> KeyValues\* -> URI\* -> KeyValues -> ...

Streams are useful because they can be filtered and transformed
which matters because keys and values from various sources often need transformation. 
For example environment variable names often need to be converted to lower case
and some prefix removed.

**In short it is a micro configuration framework that itself can be configured with key values.**

## Example

A simple example using `java.util.Properties` files that could be parsed to `KeyValues` would be:


```java
var kvs = KeyValuesSystem.defaults()
  .loader()
  .variables(Variables::ofSystemProperties) // Use system properties as base variables for interpolation
  .add("classpath:/start.properties")
  .add("system:///") // add system properties to override
  .add("env:///")    // add env variables to override
  .add("cmd:///-D")  // add command line for final override using the prefix of -D
  .load();

// give the key values to some other config framework like Spring:
var map = kvs.toMap();
ConfigurableEnvironment env = applicationContext.getEnvironment();
env.getPropertySources().addFirst(new MapPropertySource("start", map));
```

**start.properties** (first loaded):

```properties
message=Hello ${user.name}
_load_foo=classpath:/foo.properties
port.prefix=1
```

(take note of the `_load_foo` key)

**foo.properties loaded** (second loaded resource):


```properties

user.name=Barf
message=Merchandising
db.port=${port.prefix}5672
_load_user=file:/${user.home}/.config/myapp/user.properties
_flags_user=sensitive,no_require
```
(take note of the `_load_user` and `_flags_user` key)

**user.properties** (third loaded resource treated as sensitive)

```properties
secret=12345 # my luggage combination
port.prefix=3
```

After that system properties, then environment variables and then command line key values are added. 

Ignoring environment variables and system properties our effective key values printed out will be:

```properties
message=Merchandising
user.name=Barf
port.prefix=3
db.port=35672
secret=REDACTED
```


Let us go back to the original code. It should be pretty
obvious now that the same thing can be done like: 

```java
var kvs = KeyValuesSystem.defaults()
  .loader()
  .add("classpath:/start.properties")
  .load();
```

With `start.properties` having the additional key values:

```properties
message=Hello ${user.name}
port.prefix=1
_load_foo=classpath:/foo.properties
_load_system=system:///
_load_env=env:///
_load_cmd=cmd:///-D
```

(If you don't like the syntax of the special loading keys that is indeed configurable... through key values of course.)

## Kiwi is NOT a `System.getProperty` or other config framework replacement

Most configuration frameworks are focused on *"binding"*, dependency injection, or ergonomics on a
`Map<String,String>`. They are focused on transforming the flat key values to objects. Kiwi does not do that. 
**These libraries often have a very opinionated loading scheme**
and often the only way to configure that is through code. 

Kiwi is lower level than most config libraries but yet allows the configuration to happen in configuration. 
It is mostly concerned with loading and because of its zero dependency and no logging architecture it can be 
used very early to provide other early init libraries with a `Map<String,String>`
(or the complete stream of key values found). That is why there is not really a `getProperty(key)`
like method provided by `kiwi-kvs`. That is for configuration frameworks downstream.

In fact Kiwi rather just fill `System.getProperties` from loaded resources so that
you do not have to use another library for configuration lookup. That is for retrieval 
a singleton like `System.getProperties` is often good enough for simple applications. 

Yes Kiwi is very simple but [simple is good](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/).

That being said if you need a System.getProperty like replacement Kiwi does provide an
opinionated module.

### Kiwi Boot 

While the Kiwi KVS core does not provide an opinion on loading Kiwi does provide a separate opinionated
module (kiwi-boot) that more or less mimics Spring Boot's loading of configuration without requiring Spring Boot.

This module also serves another purpose in that it is example code of using kiwi-kvs you can copy and customize 
for your own applications/libraries. 

## Kiwi's advantages:

* **Zero opinions** - it does not assume you want to load `app.properties` first. You define what resources and order.
* Zero dependencies
* Zero reflection
* Zero auto loading - you pick that
* Zero logging (unless you want it)
*  a `module-info.java`, jspecify annotations, and  jdk 21 ready.
* **Framework agnostic!**
* Fast initialization
* Simple interpolation system that can be disabled for certain resources
* Certain resources can be treated as sensitive
* Extendable key value format loading
* Chaining of overriding key values
* Can simulate other configuration frameworks loading easily with k/v configuration.
* Allow users to choose where configuration comes from without recompiling.

The last point is what really separates out Kiwi from other systems. 
For example if you want to use environment variables with some special prefix without recompiling the application
you can. Or perhaps you want to use a special properties file in your home directory.
While there are applications and such that allow naive file *"includes"* (for example NGINX) but usually it is only files.

## Architecture

Kiwi's two major concepts are:

1. KeyValues - a stream of key values
1. Resources - a URI with associated key value meta data.

Resources are used to load key values and key values can be used to specify and find more resources 
(to load more key values). Kiwi is recursive.

For the rest of the explanation of architecture we will go bottom up.

### KeyValue

A `KeyValue` object in Kiwi unlike a `Map.Entry<String,String>` has more information than just the simple tuple of `key` and `value`. 

`KeyValue` are:

* Immutable
* Have interpolated value as well as the original pre-interpolated value
* Have source information
* Whether or not it should be used for interpolation
* Whether or not it should be printed out ever (e.g. a password or other sensitive information)

Kiwi provides ergonomics working with streams of key values to filter, and collect key values
as well as parse and format.

**Notice that Kiwi is like a list of key values and thus:**

* Order can be important
* There can be duplicate "keys" (that may or may not override in the final result)

Finally a `KeyValue` can be a special key that can reference another resource to load.

These keys are usually prefixed with `_` to avoid collision and maximum compatibility.
The most important one is `_load_name` where name is the name you like to give the resource and the value is a `URI`.
This mini DSL syntax in the future will be configurable so that you can pick different key name patterns.

### Interpolation

Kiwi can do Bash like interpolation on a stream of `KeyValues`. It does this by using
the key values themselves and `Variables`. `Variables` are simply `Function<String,String>`.
This allows you to interpolate on key values with things you do not want in the final
result (`KeyValues`). For example a common practice is to use `System.getProperties()` as variables
but often you do not want all of the system properties to end up in the `KeyValues`.

Interpolation can be disabled with the resource flag `no_interpolation`.

Furthermore you can load up a resource as variables instead of `KeyValues`
with the resource flag `no_add`.

```properties
# first loaded properties
_load_system=system:///
_flags_system=no_add
_load_app=classpath:/app.properties
```

Often interpolation will create a new stream of KeyValues where the value
part of the key is replaced with the interpolated results however the original value
is always retained.

### KeyValuesResource 

A `KeyValuesResource` has a `URI` and symbolic name (used to find configuration). 
It is backed by a key value with additional meta data on how to load that resource. 
URIs are designed to point at resources and the additional meta data 
in a `KeyValuesResource` surprise surprise is more `KeyValues`. 

The additional meta data is used to know how to load the key values 
and what meta data should be associated with each key value.

Some examples are:

* The key values from the resource are sensitive and should not be easily printed out
* The key values should not be interpolated because the data is raw
* The loaded key values should or should not load other key values

This is all configurable again through key values (and URIs) particularly
the `_flags_name` key.

The default key value pattern to specify resources is:

```properties
_load_[name]=URI
_flags_[name]=CSV of flag names
_param_[name]_[key]=String
```
The `[name]` part should be replaced with a name of ones choosing where only case sensitive alphanumeric characters are allowed. 

#### Resource Flags

This is currently a subset of the flags:

* `no_require` - Resources are usually required to exist otherwise failure. This flag makes them not required.
* `sensitive` - The key values loaded from the resource will be marked as sensitive and thus will not be outputted on `toString` etc.
* `no_add` - The key values will not be added to the final result but will be used as `variables`.
* `no_load_children` - The resource is not allowed to chain additional resources (not allowed to use `_load_`).

### KeyValuesLoader

A KeyValues loader usually takes a  `KeyValuesResource` and turns it into `KeyValues`.

It is an extension point that in simple terms takes a URI and loads `KeyValues` usually
based on the schema of the URI. For example `classpath` will use the JDK 
classloader mechanism and `file` will use `java.io`/`java.nio` file loading.

This part of the library is extendable and custom loaders can be manually wired or the service loader can be used.

Out of the box Kiwi supports by schema:

* `classpath`
* `file`
* `system` - System properties
* `env` - Environment variables
* `cmd` - Command line argument pairs separated by `=`.
* `profile.[schema]` - Will load multiple resources based on a CSV of profiles where the profile name replaces part of the URI.

Other URI schemas will be added soon usually as separate modules like dotenv, HOCON, Terraform/Tofu `tfvars.json` format etc.

#### Profiles URI

Probably the more confusing KeyValuesLoader is the `profile` which deserves an example:

```properties
PROFILES=profile1,profile2 # this could come from env variable

_load_profiles=profile.classpath:/app-__PROFILE__.properties
_param_profiles_profile=${PROFILES}
_flags_profiles=no_require
```

Which will try to load:

* `classpath:/app-profile1.properties`
* `classpath:/app-profile2.properties`

But not fail if those resources are not found.

The above is not special internal encapsulated logic. The profiles loader just
generates key values:

```properties
_load_profiles1=classpath:/app-profile1.properties
_flags_profiles1=no_require
_load_profiles2=classpath:/app-profile2.properties
_flags_profiles2=no_require
```

So one can make something similar if they like.

### KeyValuesMedia

Some `KeyValuesLoader` will know how to parse the `URI` directly to key values
BUT many will will want to use a parser. 

Kiwi provides a framework to parse and format key values from/to byte streams, 
or strings based on ["media type" aka "Content Type" aka MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) 
or file extension.

This part of the library is extendable and custom media types can be manually wired or the service loader can be used.

Out of the box Kiwi supports:

 * `java.util.Properties` format.
 * URL Query percent encoding format.

Other formats will be added soon usually as separate modules like dotenv, HOCON, Terraform/Tofu `tfvars.json` format etc.

### KeyValuesSystem

This is the entrypoint into Kiwi and used to load the initial part of the chain of resources.
The bootstrapping part of your application will call it first and will often and of the
the loaded key values to something else.

## History

This library is a rewrite of an organic part of my companies code base that
has been evolving for over 14 years.

Many libraries and frameworks have come and gone with differing opinions on configuration. 
While our backing frameworks have changed over the years our configuration style, format
and behavior because of the library has largely not thanks to the flexibility.

*Opinionated maybe vogue but **not** opinionated goes the distance.*

## Other work

* [avaje-config](https://avaje.io/config/) 

Kiwi hopes to bring many of its concepts and design to `avaje-config`.
